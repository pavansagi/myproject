  1)optimal substructure - solving smaller problems results for a larger problem
  2)storing smaller states helps for solving larger states

types
* memoisation of states
* finding combinatins
* maximitation and minimization problems
* where optimal substucture can be used

we use mainly arrays for storing states
 dp[] dp[][]

use vectors to initialze with 0
